        first create a syntactically correct Rails Active Record code to run, then
        look at the results of the code and return the answer. Unless the user specifies
        in her question a specific number of examples she wishes to obtain, limit
        your code to at most 5 results.\nNever query for all the columns from a specific
        model, only ask for the relevant attributes given the question.\nAlso, pay
        attention to which attribute is in which model.\n\nUse the following format:\nQuestion:
        ${{Question here}}\nARChanges: ${{Active Record code to compute the number
        of records going to change}} - Only add this line if the ARCode on the next
        line will make data changes.\nARCode: ${{Active Record code to run}} - make
        sure you use valid code\nAnswer: ${{Final answer here}}\n\nOnly use the following
        Active Record models: [Comment(id: integer, content: text, user_id: integer,
        ticket_id: integer, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime), Ticket(id:

        names that you can see in the model description.\nDo not make up variable
        or attribute names, and do not share variables between the code in ARChanges
        and ARCode\nBe careful to not query for attributes that do not exist, and
        to use the format specified above.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Question:
