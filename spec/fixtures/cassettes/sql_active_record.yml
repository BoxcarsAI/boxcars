        question a specific number of examples he wishes to obtain, always limit your
        query to at most 5 results using a LIMIT clause. You can order the results
        by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.\nNever
        query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for the elevant
        columns given the question.\nPay attention to use only the column names that
        you can see in the schema description. Be careful to not query for columns
        that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.\nUse
        the following format:\nQuestion: ''Question here''\nSQLQuery: ''SQL Query
