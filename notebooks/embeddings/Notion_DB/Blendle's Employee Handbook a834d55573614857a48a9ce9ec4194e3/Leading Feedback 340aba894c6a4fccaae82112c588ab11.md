# Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms. **Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ‘Didn’t we discuss this already a year ago? It’s still an issue’. It also shows that you don’t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don’t save up feedback, it’s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality

- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It’s important and it's not going to happen if you don’t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn’t. Goal is to ‘stay in touch’ and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?** 
    
    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here’s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What’s going on in your life at the moment? What’s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.
    
    Last but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn’t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.
    
    We can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1’s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.

    [One-on-Ones - Part 3 (Hall Of Fame Guidance) | Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-3)
    
    A great book on this topic is ‘High Output Management’ from Andy Grove. Available here, let us know if you'd like to read this and we can order it for you.

- **Give input and flag**
    
    You are the gatekeeper for the performance and development of your team members. If people excel, we should reward them. If someone is underperforming we should look for solutions. We want you to flag both situations with the MT and the HR team. First step is to tell the team member yourself, but keep 'the rest' in the loop too. 
    
    Don't wait for a review cycle or contract which expires to give this a thought.
    
- Optional: **Skip level session and upward feedback**
    
    **Skip level session:** 
    
    Also called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. 
    
    “If you’re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,” Scott says. But she’s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting — commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'
    
    The process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you’ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager — and that the meeting is not for attribution.
    
    “In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,” says Scott. “If there were too many things the team didn’t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn’t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.”

    Just let us know if you would like one and we will organize it for you :).
    
    **Upward feedback**
    
    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR’s.
