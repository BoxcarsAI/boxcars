Gmail hacks: make your inbox work for you.

- Enable undo send
- Use Boomerang: send later and get reminders on e-mails
- Use filters with priorities
- Use shortcuts
- Use search, don't put emails into folders, just archive
- Try pause inbox: a feature from Boomerang which delivers you your emails at set times instead of all through the day.
