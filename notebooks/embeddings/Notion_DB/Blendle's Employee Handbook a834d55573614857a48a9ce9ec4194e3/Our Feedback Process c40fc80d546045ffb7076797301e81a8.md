# Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ðŸ™‚) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

### (**3) If you have questions on your feedback, grab a coffee with your team-mates to clarify (this is not mandatory)**

### **(4) Consolidate everything, compare your self assessment to peer feedback, prepare  ideas and set-up a coaching session with your manager.  While you lead the session, your manager will coach you with the goal of agreeing on your development plan.  Click below for the template and Save a Copy to your own drive.**

- Donâ€™t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

ðŸ’¡ Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?
