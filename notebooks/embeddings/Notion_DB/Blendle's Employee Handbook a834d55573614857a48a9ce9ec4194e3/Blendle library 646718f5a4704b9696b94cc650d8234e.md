# Blendle library

There is so. much. good. stuff out there. The Blendle library is a virtual and physical place to share good reads/listens/watches. 

Let your inner nerd out!

- **The physical library(tje)**
    
    Weâ€™ve got 4 shelves reserved next to the LINDA for good books to share and loan. As you can see we have a lot of room, so feel free to come up with suggestions on what books to buy or bring a book you want to share. We have two 'empty' sections, so go ahead and fill them if you want to. 
    
- **The virtual library**
    
    Again, there is so much good stuff out there. The virtual library is a way to not let it go to waste and share good stuff we see online.
    
    Here is how it works: you read, hear, watch something great: share and recommend it here. The other way around: you get to see what your colleagues read and can be inspired by it.
