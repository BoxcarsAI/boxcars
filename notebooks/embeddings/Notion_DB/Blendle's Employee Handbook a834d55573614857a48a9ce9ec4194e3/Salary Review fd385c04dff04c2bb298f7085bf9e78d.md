# Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *"give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see "**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?"**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?
    - Giving a raise to an individual changes the salary house, so keep that in mind when you decide on a raise. Does this apply to more people?
