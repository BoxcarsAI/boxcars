# Bike parking Utrecht

We like to compensate for the lack of good bike parking space around our office. That’s why Blendle will pay for your [U-stall yearly subscription](https://www.u-stal.nl/) (these are not NS parkings, but from Gemeente). So whenever you arrive at the office, you don’t have to worry about finding a good parking spot, your bike getting stolen or being completely soaked at the end of the day.

**Do I get a reimbursement? yes, if...**

- You live in Utrecht or come to the office by bike regularly.
- You have a Blendle contract, at least 28 hours .
- You already had a subscription registered under your name. In this case you can be compensated for the remaining months of your existing subscription.

**What’s being reimbursed?**

A yearly subscription to U-stal, bike parking throughout Utrecht city. You can apply for one here: [https://www.veiligstallen.nl/utrecht/abonnement](https://www.veiligstallen.nl/utrecht/abonnement)

**How will Blendle pay you back?**

After purchasing and paying for the subscription, you can send your invoice to [finance@blendle.com](mailto:finance@blendle.com) and [hr@blendle.com](mailto:hr@blendle.com). The amount will be refunded back to you on a monthly basis and pro rato, as long as you work at Blendle. Note: the subscription must be registered under your name.

**Example payout:**

- The yearly subscription costs are €72,-.
- You purchase a subscription on 10-12-2019 which ends on 10-12-2020.
- Each month you get refunded by Blendle equal to 1/12 of the total costs, eg, €6 per month until 10-12-2020 or until you no longer work at Blendle.
