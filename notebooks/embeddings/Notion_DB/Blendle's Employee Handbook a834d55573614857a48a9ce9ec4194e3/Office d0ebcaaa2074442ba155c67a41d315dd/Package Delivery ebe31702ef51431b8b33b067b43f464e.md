# Package Delivery

You can order a package to be delivered to the office ðŸš›:

- Delivery address: **Blendle Catharijnesingel 52 (4 hoog), 3511 GC Utrecht**
    - make sure that you mention `Blendle` in the address:
        - example: fill the `name` field with `Alice Blendle` or `Bob Blendle`
        
- If the package does not fit in the mailbox:
    - The courier will ring the bell to leave the package.
    - If you are not at the office:
        - Usually there is somebody most of the time at the office.
        - They will receive it for you, then you can find your package in the canteen on the first big table. Or a nice co-worker might bring it to you.
- If the package fits in the mailbox:
    - Usually @Vera Eelkema takes the posts out of the mailbox every work-day.
    - What shall I do if Vera is not at the office ðŸ¤”?: (JoÃ«lle also has a key at her desk)
        - You can find the post box keys (with a blue thing attached to it) at her desk:
            - Editorial area â†’ third desk from the left facing towards the studio.
            - Will be nice to take the rest of package(s) / mail(s) and leave them on Vera's desk.
