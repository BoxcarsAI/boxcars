# People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The "unlimited fair use" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose "Verlof". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.

    **0-hour contracts**  Do not show a time off balance as holidays are paid out monthly together with the salary
    
    **We would like to highlight this once more, the "unlimited fair use" rule stays. Addition of the balance is for legal reasons. And your balance will be topped up at the start of each year. Negative balances are fine and also erased at the start of each new year.** 
    

- **Claim Expenses**
    
    To claim any expenses you paid in advance, like business commute, business lunches, conference, books etc.. log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/)  account, click on "Expenses Declaration" . **Remember to chose the right sort of expense!** Fill in the right amount, upload the invoice and done.
