# Travel costs and reimbursements

**CAR AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT TO THE OFFICE**

You will need to travel for Blendle (mostly from home to work and back). Blendle will cover your costs. Just look for the cheapest option (spend the money like it is your own).

**When you travel by train:** Officemanagement will get you an NS Business card, so all your home<>work travel is covered by Blendle.   To request an NS card, send an email to officemanagement@blendle.com

**When travelling by car**: you keep track of your kilometers and send an excel doc (or email) to finance@blendle and hr@blendle.com once a month to get your travel costs reimbursed. You'll get 0,19 per KM. HR can get you a parking card for P1.

When travelling by bike : you can use U-Stal parking.

We will re-imburse you for an annual subscription to help it make you park your bike in Utrecht city centre and be close the the office.  Setup your subscription here and reimburse to finance
