# Pension

- **Pension:** 
we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think itâ€™s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside goes straight to your pension. You can sign up through [THIS PAGA](https://brightpensioen.nl/werknemer/word-bright/)
You can join a webinar for more info on [https://brightpensioen.nl/event/pensioen-faciliteren/](https://brightpensioen.nl/event/pensioen-faciliteren/)
